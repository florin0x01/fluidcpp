|   HOW TO COMPILE    |	
|_____________________|

-> Operating systems: Linux, possibly BSD, Windows -> contact me
-> Use compilers: g++ 4.4 or g++ 4.6
-> Step 1. Ensure you have the dependencies. Unarchive the contents. 
-> Step 2. mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
-> Step 3. Done. You should have the binaries in the build/ folder along with some tests

DEPENDS ON:	cmake (build system), libcurl, JsonCpp (http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net)

Many thanks to Terry Jones and the FluidInfo team for answering my questions.
